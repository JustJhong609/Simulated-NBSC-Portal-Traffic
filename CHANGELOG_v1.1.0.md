   - Check that various ISP providers are displayed across markers

2. **Active Now Counter**:
   - Refresh page and observe active count updates
   - Change time filters and verify count changes appropriately

3. **Bar Chart**:
   - Verify top 10 barangays are displayed
   - Hover over bars to see tooltips
   - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes

4. **Peak Hour**:
   - Verify peak hour calculation shows correct time range
   - Check that visit count matches data

5. **Trend Indicator**:
   - Change time filters and observe trend percentage updates
   - Verify arrow direction and color match trend

6. **Last Updated**:
   - Note timestamp when page loads
   - Change filter and verify timestamp updates
   - Click refresh and verify timestamp updates

7. **Export CSV**:
   - Click Export CSV button
   - Open downloaded file and verify all fields are present
   - Check that data matches filtered view

## Deployment Notes

1. Regenerate traffic data before deployment:
   ```bash
   cd data-simulator
   python generate_traffic.py
   ```

2. Copy generated data to frontend:
   ```bash
   cp ../data/simulated_traffic.json ../frontend/public/data/
   ```

3. Install new dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Future Enhancement Ideas
